BTW, I know Snowbird may not care, but we may want to compare/contrast
with "Ensemble selection from libraries of models" (Caruana et al.
ICML 2004) since we have already used a similar method and it worked
really well "vanilla" (that's how we got 80% with L3s on Caltech 101,
a long time ago ;-).

Other interesting references (from some old notes):
- Popular Ensemble Methods: An Empirical Study (Opitz & Maclin JMLR 1999)
- Ensemble learning (Brown 2009)
- Ensemble-based classifiers (Rokach 2010)
There are more references that I have somewhere in a file but I can't
put my hands on them.
